# MaxFlaskProject

Leaving project to start new one using Dash, which I believe will better suit my needs.

Takeaways from this project
- pipenv has some bugs when trying to install new packages into the environment and limited support.  I may try virtualenv next.
- It's easy to incorporate bootstrap, or any css and other templates in Flask.  However, not much new from PHP or ASP from 20 years ago.  The templating language is just another thing to learn.
- There is more I need to learn on how best to set up projects with git and visual code.
