# MaxFlaskProject

1/7/2020: Leaving project to start new one using Dash, which I believe will better suit my needs.

Takeaways from this project
- pipenv has some bugs when trying to install new packages into the environment and limited support.  I may try virtualenv next.
- Ran into buggy issues with Conda before this project.  I need to keep to my core belief that I shouldn't use anything unless I have a very specific need.  I understand why conda and pipenv have benefits.  I just don't need them yet and have spent a lot of time trying to figure out why I was getting various errors.
- It's easy to incorporate bootstrap, or any css and other templates in Flask.  However, not much new from PHP or ASP from 20 years ago.  The templating language is just another thing to learn.
- There is more I need to learn on how best to set up projects with git and visual code.
