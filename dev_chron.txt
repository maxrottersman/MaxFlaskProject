Going to go through this tutorial
https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world

python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pipenv

# Create shell
pipenv shell

import sys
sys.executable
says virtual environment stored here:
C:\\Users\\user\\.virtualenvs\\MaxsFlaskProject-FoktuD9_\\Scripts\\python.exe

Had to reload VC so the environment showed up for the project

pipenv install flask
    checked, it made addition to Pipfile

remember to run: 
pipenv shell
so terminal is running same environment

pipenv install flask-sqlalchemy
pipenv install flask-migrate (makes migrations/table changes easier in future?)
pipenv install alembic

# Create repo on github that pushed folder I was working on, on studio pc
git remote add origin https://github.com/maxrottersman/MaxFlaskProject.git
git push -u origin master

On Home PC, couldn't figure out how to clone from VC, so openned
git cmd windows:
git clone  https://github.com/maxrottersman/MaxFlaskProject.git .
(if already a .git folder, delete, above need empty folder)
(also, weird character in line so got fatal flaw error before fix)
